          Today marks the day I finished the first module of the Cloud Engineer
          Academy.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>I have been dabbling with AWS for some time now, but I still
          felt as though there were things I didn't know. This uncertainty is
          largely why I invested in the Cloud Engineer Academy, because, in some
          cases, "you don't know what you don't know." Also, I said to myself,
          "How can someone invest in you if you can't even invest in yourself?"
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Needless to say, from just this first module, I have taken much, be it
          reinforcing what I already knew, developing an understanding of what I
          was unsure of beforehand, and giving me a new (or should I say
          corrected) perspective on the cloud and what it means to be in a cloud
          role.

        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bolder" }}> My Takeaway</p>
        <p>
          Above all else, it was enlightening to understand just how a Cloud
          Engineer integrates into the software development lifecycle. The
          explanation gave me a much clearer picture of what being a Cloud
          Engineer means in a software development team.

          The module has helped me get a better understanding of things that I
          otherwise had an idea of but just didn't quite grasp fully.
          Specifically, cloud computing models, cloud deployment models, and
          virtualization, as I understand these to be fundamental concepts that
          need to be understood before even thinking of joining a team.

        <p>
          Learning about Cloud Operating Systems and the role they play in the
          world of cloud computing was very much an introduction for me in this
          module. Given this new understanding, I can now more or less
          distinguish one when I see it. I look forward to learning more about
          it, as we informed we would go more in depth with this later on.
        </p>

        <p style={{ fontWeight: "bolder" }}>Conclusion</p>
        <p>
          Prior to even joining the Academy, watching videos from Tech With
          Soleyman gave me a perspective on the type of role I want to seek
          after, something about which I was more or less clueless before. I
          consider this module to be engaging and beginner-friendly, and I am
          more than satisfied with it so far. I believe it is perfect for me, as
          the curriculum encompasses most of what I seek. Although the module I
          look forward to the most has not yet arrived, I am eager to continue
          learning.

          Happy Learning,
          <br></br>
